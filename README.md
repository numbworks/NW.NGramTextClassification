## In Short

From the documentation:

> `NW.NGramTextClassification` is a `.NET Standard` library written in `C#` to perform `Text Classification` on the string of text you provide.

> `Text Classification` is a `machine learning` technique that calculates the similarity between the string of text you need to categorize and a collection of already categorized strings you provide to the library to learn from it. 

> A `Text Classification` library can be super-useful for the resolution of many problems, such as `spam detection` or `language detection` in an automated environment.
