## In Short

From the documentation:

> `NW.MarkdownTables` is a `.NET Standard 2.0` library written in `C#` to create Markdown tables out of the provided objects. 

> It makes very easy to format objects in tabular format while logging and to create examples for the documentation of the project while developing it.

## Download the source code

I assume you are on `Windows`, but the library should compile without issues on `Linux` as well. Please:

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win);
2. Open `Windows Powershell` (or `Windows Terminal` or similar) and type:

```powershell
PS C:\> mkdir NW.MarkdownTables
PS C:\> cd .\NW.MarkdownTables\
PS C:\NW.MarkdownTables> git clone https://github.com/numbworks/NW.MarkdownTables.git
```

3. Open `NW.MarkdownTables.sln` with `Visual Studio 2017` or other IDE;
4. Done!

## Download the binary packages
